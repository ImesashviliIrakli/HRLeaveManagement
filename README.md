# Clean Architecture and CQRS Demonstration

Welcome to our demonstration project showcasing the effective use of Clean Architecture and the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern in software development.

## Overview

This project is built using the principles of Clean Architecture, a software design philosophy that separates the software into concentric layers with a strong emphasis on separation of concerns. This results in a system that is independent of UI, database, framework, and external agency. It is highly maintainable, testable, and easy to understand and contribute to.

The project also utilizes the CQRS pattern, which separates the read (Query) operations from the write (Command) operations, thereby improving performance, scalability, and security. This pattern allows for the independent scaling of read and write workloads and simplifies the design and implementation of the system.

## Features

- **Clean Architecture:** Organized into concentric layers, promoting separation of concerns.
- **CQRS Pattern:** Segregation of read (Query) and write (Command) operations for enhanced performance and scalability.
- **Independence:** The system is independent of UI, database, framework, and external agencies.
- **Maintainable:** Highly maintainable codebase with a focus on clarity and simplicity.
- **Testable:** Built with testability in mind, facilitating easy testing and quality assurance.
